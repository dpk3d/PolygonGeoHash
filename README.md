## Polygon to Geohash Conversion
This repository provides a utility for converting polygons into geohashes at a specified precision level (Geohash-9). It leverages boundary box calculations and geohash utilities to process geographical data effectively.

## Features:
1. Converts polygons to Geohash-9.
2. Utilizes bounding box calculations for efficient geohash generation.
3. Supports both point and polygon inputs for geohash conversion.
## How It Works:
1. Input: You can provide a point or a polygon as input.
2. Process: The boundary box of the polygon is computed, followed by geohash encoding at level 9.
3. Output: The corresponding Geohash-9 values for the given polygon or point are returned.
